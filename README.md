# League of Legends KDA Statistical Analysis
With a focus on the aggregated kills, deaths, and assists (KDA) variable, this UCSD project seeks to analyze the relevance of this statistic within League of Legends matches and its impact on in-game statistics and outcomes.

## Introduction
### Project Overview
League of Legends (LoL), otherwise known as League, is an online multiplayer battle game that focuses on player-on-player combat in a team setting. With players controlling various characters, or "champions", players can utilize various methods such as gaining experience points, gold, or items in order to defeat the opposing team, and thus, its gameplay being popular with players worldwide. This analysis will focus on a dataset developed by Oracle's Elixir.

The dataset contains gameplay statistics spanning across various matches, detailing both player and team info across categories such as champion selection, overall performance, and overall progress towards securing a game win. While distinct from each other, these categories provide detailed context as to how player and team in-game choices and dynamics can vary and drastically impact overall results.

In LoL, kills, deaths, and assists (KDA) is a significant statistic in measuring player performance in-match. As calculated by the equation below, understanding KDA is essential to evaluating at a player's overall contributions to team results, with a higher KDA meaning a more impactful performance (players have a higher kills and assists ratio to deaths). With KDA varying across player roles, KDA plays a key part in analyzing team strategy, allowing us to get a glimpse into how effectively maxmizing player roles can lead to positive team outcomes.
$$KDA = (Kills + Assists) / Deaths$$

I will be focusing on answering the central question: **How effective is KDA as a measure of player and team performance in-game?**. While KDA itself is a good baseline metric, with other factors such as skill of an overall league, and other metrics of performance such as dpm, KDA's effectivenss as a metric might not capture all factors that could lead to a team winning/losing. In conjunction with the predictive model used, insights gained can be used to optimize team strategy and decision making, leading to consistent and positive performance across games.
